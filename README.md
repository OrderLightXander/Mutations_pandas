# Mutations_pandas
In the year 3020 a new deadly superbug, Martia Auris, was discovered in a human
habitat on Mars. Superbug is a term for bacterias strains, viruses, or fungi
resistant to most of the antibiotics and other medications commonly used in the
31st century. Martia Auris is a bacteria strain conducted only by humans, is highly
infectious, gives symptoms very late and the mortality rate after infection
exceeds 15%. It's currently estimated that about 5% of the Martian colony can be
infected.
The martian laboratories collected many samples and performed sequencing on
the bacteria. Our task is to write scripts to support researchers by identifying
common mutations and analyzing genomes for the existence of specific
substrings.
The script is written in Python.
